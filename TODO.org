'I' in *rfcinfo* -> close window

cleaner way to define keymap?
(mapc (lambda (p) (define-key rfcview-mode-map (car p) (cdr p)))
      '(( "0" . rfcinfo-goto)
	( "1" . rfcinfo-bortzmeyer)))

use with-temp-message?

* bugs
** TODO -next-section stops on BCPxxx
because it searches for unindented lines

** TODO importing xml loops?
can't reproduce

** TODO if cancel during import, then believes is up to date
** TODO BCP
doc and code assumes a BCP maps to only one rfc
false: eg bcp41
rfc2914 updated by rfc7141

also bcp 47 (misses 5646)
then, what title to use?
a title is given in
"/anonymous@ftp.ripe.net:/rfc/bcp-index.txt"

list of multi-rfc bcps (as of 09/28/2014)
bcp6, 9, 10, 13, 25, 37, 41, 47, 79, 97, 101, 111, 127, 153

also allow access to info at http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47
and other subseries /fyi12 /std35

*** fix
    -lookup-subseries, then -get-rfc-status

** TODO C-c r in rfc uses this one as arg
it shouldn't, we use 'I' for that
'i' and 'I' use docid at point if there's one (?)

should set 'non-local in rfcinfo-show, but don't want to apply when
called with 'I'

provide another key binding?
to another fun rfcinfo-show-other

or the other way: rfcinfo-show-this-one for i/I
=> change semantics of non-local to use-local?

** rfcinfo-show with empty string
or single letter
** DONE irfc: buffer name is not rfcxxxx.txt

* current problems
** DONE import is loooong
parsing the xml file can be very long (more than 1 min) on a not so
recent machine...
(4 min on 1Ghz 256MB)

could fork a process to do it asynchronously?
import, save rfcinfo-dbfile, notify main process and terminate
main process then reloads rfcinfo-dbfile

or batch import, and:
 reload (possibly through emacsclient)
 display result of last import ('N' is ok)

*** optimize abstract import -> no
could also not reimport all abstract info (abstracts file size is two
times db file size)

time emacs -Q --batch -l ~/Src/rfcinfo/rfcinfo.el -f rfcinfo-import => 13.027 s

without abstract
time emacs -Q --batch -l ~/Src/rfcinfo/rfcinfo.el.~HEAD~ -f rfcinfo-import => 12.927 s

** xml abstract should not include '[series]' at the end
** DONE rfcinfo-open should not automatically download a one digit rfc number
automatic for 3 digits or more

** should not "load" 'cl?
see cl info, section 2
-> (eval-when-compile (require 'cl))

** title search could be case sensitive
for acronyms like HAS

** TODO build-ref fails with irfc
not a bug since build-ref not documented

** does not update '+' (local availability status) when downloaded
** sets mark two times while loading?
** RFC download part should go in rfcview?
is already handled by irfc
see if it's ok and better

** clean up xml import code
+l in ref counts visible lines in rfcview mode...
=> no?

** errata for unknown, browser displays whole list of errata
** errata should read from minibuffer if not found at point
       should use current rfc from rfcview! (or use I, e ?)
  if no arg && rfcinfo-mode, use this one
  if arg && rfcinfo-mode, ask
  if no arg && no rfcinfo-mode, use point, ask if none
  if arg && no rfcinfo-mode, use point, ask with default

** rfc1035-5 currently fails (item number 5 found)
same rfc2205-1
  -> probably only applies to level 1 headings

** DONE scroll useless (except if window too small)
** locs

build sec with +l from point
  -> based on rfcview headings

locs, use rfcview header detection
;;
1. correct them to not miss any (nor catch other things)
2. allow absence of final dot
3. 

build-ref do not use rfcview, search for section header with re-loc
-> re-sec, re-loc

** how to handle rfcview optional dependency?
 -> build-ref only (easily) callable from rfcview-mode


** init code rfcinfo-load should rather be an autoload or something like that?

** TODO newer test
sometimes download remote xml file, after import concludes there's
nothing new...  => investigate: save old one to diff them

=> Ok: RFC newly has errata
=> Ko: nothing changed in XML file
=> other possibilities?

sometimes the file is newer but hasn't changed (mdtm changed, diff empty)

* clean-up
** .cache rfc files should not be writable
** scroll bindings
space and S-space to scroll
. go to beginning

** rfcinfo-import
is really ugly!
is way too long.
need to rewrite/split it

** rfcinfo-viewfile
is it different than rfcinfo-display?
=> only applies to rfcs?

* ideas
** rfcinfo links, possibly use org-mode links (see notes.org)
or at least, use same binding \C-cl

** 'I' to close show window (convenient when opened from rfc buffer)
** DONE +/- for next/previous rfc
+ make rfcinfo-current buffer-local?

** word at point as title search suggestion
** search for near point docid
** tooltip on docids
to show title when mouse over a docid
as a minor-mode ?
in irfc ?

** allow going forward in history
with C-c C-f ? (help-mode like)
or allow to go back without undoing (emacs way?)

** DONE remember last news summary
by saving the buffer in cache directory
+ function (binding?) to load it?
=> rfcinfo-last-news

** DONE test if remote xml file is newer
get remote mdtm from (nth 5 (file-attributes ...))
get old mdtm from local db file

rfcinfo-load: load rfcinfo-xml-mdtm as well
refresh: get remote mdtm if equal abort
   else set rfcinfo-xml-mdtm, call import
   import does the saving

mdtm is a list of two 16 bit integers

** batch refresh
emacs -Q --batch -l ~/.emacs.ftp -l ~/Src/rfcinfo/rfcinfo.el -f rfcinfo-refresh

** striked 8/0
not well readable, see eg rfc2481

** DONE tab/S-tab
to navigate on blocks

** DONE when displaying STD
set point on first rfc
... in rfcinfo-display?
 -> do not put - after std docid!
but handle possible search failure (for empty std, eg STD1)

** propose to refresh if apparently run for the first time
include info in the tutorial?!

rfcinfo-refresh should first test if rfcinfo-index-xml-file dir part
exists
=> redéfinir comme utilisant rfcinfo-cache-dir (idem pour rfcinfo-dbfile)

if rfcdir does not exist, at file loading (eg from autoload)
rfcinfo-load: condition-case: Can't load from `rfcinfo-dbfile'

** DONE create cachedir if does not exist
  tested by rfcinfo-refresh only?
  + also there xml and db files ?
    redefine variables ?

see irfc-open

** customization for faces
** delete unused rfc from cache dir
* priority

** clean-up non-local arg in read-docid
** STD3 updates STD7? check this.
** use menu Elisp/check documentation strings
** a word about erratas
** make ref (doc/integration)

* additional features
** allow going forward in history
which key ?

** search author
** search in abstract
could be occur in abstracts file, but need to put each one on a
separate line (would be nicer anyway?)

** show abstract
putting abstracts in rfcinfo-status bloats it a bit:
28/06/14 rfcinfo.db w/o: 1124729, w/: 3968939 (* 3.5)

therefore we store abstracts in a text file and only store for each
rfc the begin and end offset of its abstract in the text file.

*** if rfc is cached, use its very abstract?
eg narrow to region on RFC text

*** xml abstracts
what exactly does abstract element contain in xml index?

some rfcs have no abstract, xml file provides one...
some have incomplete abstracts: 1662,1717 ...

9 September 2003 -- rfc-index.html Available

http://www.rfc-editor.org/news-archive.html
    The RFC Editor web site now contains an XML version of the
    complete RFC index file. This file, rfc-index.xml, is updated
    daily to match the venerable textual index file,
    rfc-index.txt. The corresponding XML schema is rfc-index.xsd. All
    three files are available on the RFC Database page of the RFC
    Editor web site.

** show keywords
xml file has some

** search keywords
** show recursive dependencies
** generate graph for graphviz

generate map (viz) and display it in browser
display map in emacs?
possible control back from browser to emacs?
 -> click on rfc on map -> display info in emacs...

** 3-lines status: show numbers of obsolating/updating rfcs?
** diff
show what has changed since last update
possibly remember such changes?

*** DONE newly published RFC
*** DONE status changes
*** DONE updated/obsolated changes
from list of new RFCs, build two lists

*** TODO sub-series change?
** user annotations
  (related rfcs, free text...)
  alist, integrated in vector during import (or when load-ing?)
** user lists
save named lists of rfcs
edit list (add/remove/change order)

** multiple buffer
currently only one possible
usefullness of several?

** saving buffer

simply save as text, need import text as rfcinfo buffer

for import summary, propose saving as 'New RFCs <date>'
alist string to number list
save
load (propose completion)
forget?

** provide menu

* irfc

irfc is a possible replacement for rfcview
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Irfc

** bugs inherited from rfcview
see 'rfcview problems' below
 
** installation via (setq irfc-assoc-mode t) does not work

need to use custom-set-variables (bug in irfc.el comments)

plus, need to require irfc before setting that

the regexp is a bit strange (what's the initial / and final \\' ?)

** should provide a mode hook
** irfc-page-prev
should not put point at screen middle, but rather top
(thus, page number would appear at bottom of screen with 'standard'
window size)
** show page number in mode line?
** lacks 't' to switch to text-mode

* rfcview problems
** should provide a mode hook
** loops on rfc1321
also irfc

** rfcview in debian emacs-goodies-el (but 0.12 instead of 0.13)
** bug rfc1035-3.4.2, 25 (SMTP) (section 3.4.2, taken as heading)
also irfc
 -> check final dot?
 -> check previous empty line?

** misses headings not a column 0 (eg rfc2205)
also irfc
 -> allow blanks for headings at level 2 and more?

** misses toc in rfc2206 (no end dot in toc entries)

** headings menu poorly cut when large
(do it by sections/subsections?)

** does not detect multiple references (2205 -> [RSVP93, RFC 1633])
rfcview-use-view-mode-p -flag?

** in speedbar, sections are in reverse order? (rfc1035-3)
  speedbar does its own heading parsing?
  or uses imenu???

** see shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer?

* rfcview toadds
** next/previous heading navigation ala outline or org-mode
=> outline-minor-mode?
   needs setting outline-regexp

** goto table of contents
irfc does provide it (G)

* RFCs with problems
2206 - TOC contains non existant 3.1, 3.2

6691 updates 2385 while it's already obsolated by 5925

STD in a dependency should
  - display title
  - be forwardable
but, this only occurs three times: rfc772, 780, 788...
also 2821 !

** BCP, FIY, STD-lookup

all have entries in XML file
(but sometimes empty)

    <bcp-entry>
        <doc-id>BCP0013</doc-id>
        <is-also>
            <doc-id>RFC4289</doc-id>

they can be mapped to several RFCs...

all are also referenced from the <rfc-entry>

    <rfc-entry>

        <title>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</title>
	...

            <doc-id>STD0010</doc-id>
        </is-also>
	...
    </rfc-entry>

an rfc can is-also at most one (std or fiy or bcp)
an std/fiy/bcp can is-also several (rfcs)

*** so,
we need to add is-also info in each rfc-entry

then do we:
1) handle three new arrays?
2) just search in rfc array?

note that bcp status is redondant with is-also bcp (which also gives number)

STD0010 & 39 are historic

we also need to display std (and other) info : list of mapped rfcs
(new kind of dependency - is-also/contains)

*** how are STD dependency cross-references currently handled?
they are ignored!
see in rfcinfo-fold-all

are there other than rfc2821?

*** NIC, IEN, RTR (external references)


* future

** DONE rfcinfo-fold-all number extracting assumes string format is RFCxxxx
   => will break when number 9999 is exceeded!

** evolve into a dired-like interface?
