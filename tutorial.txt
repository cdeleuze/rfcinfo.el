Let's first load lisp code:

 M-x load-file <RET> /path/to/rfcinfo.el

or if you put it in a directory searched by emacs (eg by adding 
(add-to-list 'load-path "<my dir>") in the .emacs file), just use

 M-x load-library <RET> rfcinfo

Oops! An error message is displayed.
The first thing to do is to download the rfc-index file and build the
database (this can take quite a few seconds):

 M-x rfcinfo-refresh <RET>

Now the command rfcinfo-show can be invoked, either by M-x
rfcinfo-show or by C-c r.  Just enter the chosen RFC number, say 2205.

Pretty?
Up and down arrows allow moving to RFC numbers, right arrow to
"follow" an RFC, left arrow to get back to previous state.  'q' closes
the window.

C-c r does not ask for a number if point is on an RFC number such as
rfc1034, 1035 (try it here!), unless a prefix argument is provided
(C-u C-c r).  In this case, the number is proposed as default.

The second command is rfcinfo-open, bound to C-c R.  Give it an RFC
number, the file is downloaded from `rfcinfo-remote-repository', a
copy is saved in the directory `rfcinfo-cache-dir' (default is
~/.cache/rfc/).  Please check this directory actually exists!

Displaying uses rfcview if it's installed.  If not, it can be
downloaded from http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/rfcview.el (on a
Debian system, it is included in the emacs-goodies-el package).

rfcinfo-open can also open an RFC and place the point at a specific
location.  This is very convenient to keep a reference on a specific
item.  For example (try C-c R on the following RFC references, use 'q'
to quit):

---
rfc2181-5    RR has label, class, type and data. [+ defining RRSet]
rfc2181-5.2  Resource Records also have a time to live (TTL).


AA bit: the data matching the question name is authoritative
(rfc1034-6.2.7) 

rfc1035-4.1.1+42 (line 42 after section 4.1.1)
---

That's it.  See comments in file rfcinfo.el for more details.

I welcome any comment or suggestion.
